# PainPersonalities

Chronic pain affects millions worldwide and remains a clinical challenge despite its high personal impact. Psychotherapy has shown some success in treating chronic pain refractory to conventional pharmaceutical treatment. Yet, the relationship between chronic pain and mental state, as well as the role of personality traits in this relation, are poorly understood. To investigate personality trait trends among people with chronic pain, we used machine learning techniques to develop various binary classifiers for the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator's (MBTI) personality dichotomies (extroversion-introversion, sensing-intuition, thinking-feeling, and judging-perceiving). We collected a dataset of self-reported MBTI labels and text communications, as well as an unlabelled dataset of text communications from chronic pain sufferers from Reddit.com. Our models achieved around 60\% accuracy on each axis, except for thinking-feeling, which achieved around 71\% accuracy. We used our best performing model to predict personality trait distributions in the chronic pain dataset, but due to poor performance as well as ethical concerns, we cannot draw definitive conclusions. However, our findings did suggest a potential connection between chronic pain and personality, although it may not be well captured by MBTI dimensions. Further research may identify valuable trends that could enhance the current understanding and treatment of chronic pain by healthcare professionals.
